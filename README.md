# Awesome Antibody Tools
List of databases and tools to discover, develop, and engineer antibodies.
The goal is to create a comprhensive list of tools and databases for antibody-related predictions. With this effort we are also aiming to create a gold standard for benchmarking antibody-antigen predictions.

## Datasets

## Tools

### AI-based antibody-antigen prediction
http://geobiologics-lite.biogeom.com/about - not open-source but available for non-commercial applications

### Docking-based antibody-antigen prediction
http://geobiologics-lite.biogeom.com/about - not open-source but available for non-commercial applications
DiffDockPP - AI-driven MD for PPI

### Other Antibody Tools

#### Antibody optimization


## Leaderboard

All methods should be added to a docker and tested on a gold-standard database.
